## What is the purpose of feature selection.

Usually, feature selections are typically implemented in predictive models to help determine a candidate model with good bias/variance trade off.
One of the main reasons to use feature selection is it reduces the xomplexity of a model and makes it easier for us to interpret.
They can also applied in logistic regression setting as well as multiple linear regression.
