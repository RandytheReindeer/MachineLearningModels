## Structure of Repository
**This repository will contain the following Machine Learnind Models:**

**Supervised Learning**

**Regression**
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forests
- Neural Network

**Classification**
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes

**Unsupervised Learning**
- Clustering (KNN, Hierarchical, Mean Shift, Density-Based)

**Dimensionality Reduction**

- PCA

##  
**The main purpose of this repo is to practice and learn to create prediction models. Some of the examples will based off of tutiorals or projects I have done.**
